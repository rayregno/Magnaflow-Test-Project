# Magnaflow-Test-Project

This is my first time using GitHub, vscode, flexbox, border radius...

It's amazing how far web development has advanced in the last 16 years since I've actively been coding. 
There is so much that we used to have to do from scratch (corner images for rounded boxes for example).
I'm excited to continue learning and get up to speed with all the new tools available. 
It's been a long time but it coding feels like home.
